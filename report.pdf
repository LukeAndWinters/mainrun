# Mainrun Training Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the optimization of a GPT-2 style language model training pipeline, achieving a **24% improvement** in validation loss compared to the baseline. The final validation loss was reduced from **1.753** (baseline) to **1.328** (optimized), significantly exceeding the target of beating 1.754.

## Problem Statement

**Objective:** Minimize validation loss for a GPT-2 style model training on Hacker News headlines within 7 epochs.

**Constraints:**
- Fixed 7 epochs, random seed, dataset, and validation fraction
- Cannot modify the `evaluate()` function
- Cannot use pre-trained weights or data augmentation
- All other aspects (model, optimizer, hyperparameters) are modifiable

**Baseline Performance:** Validation loss of 1.753

## Changes Made

### 1. Optimizer Upgrade: SGD → AdamW

**What Changed:**
```python
# Before (SGD)
opt = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=args.lr, weight_decay=args.weight_decay)
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(opt, T_max=max_steps)

# After (AdamW)
opt = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=args.lr, weight_decay=args.weight_decay, betas=(0.9, 0.95))
```

**Why This Change:**
- **SGD Limitations:** Stochastic Gradient Descent is suboptimal for transformer architectures due to sparse gradients and complex loss landscapes
- **AdamW Advantages:** 
  - Adaptive learning rates per parameter
  - Momentum-based updates that handle sparse gradients better
  - Decoupled weight decay for better regularization
  - Proven superior performance on language models

**Expected Impact:** 10-15% improvement in convergence speed and final performance

### 2. Learning Rate Scheduling: Simple Cosine → Warmup + Cosine Decay

**What Changed:**
```python
# Added warmup + cosine decay function
def get_lr(step: int, warmup_steps: int, max_steps: int, base_lr: float) -> float:
    """Learning rate with warmup + cosine decay"""
    if step < warmup_steps:
        return base_lr * step / warmup_steps
    else:
        progress = (step - warmup_steps) / (max_steps - warmup_steps)
        return base_lr * 0.5 * (1 + math.cos(math.pi * progress))

# Applied in training loop
current_lr = get_lr(step, args.warmup_steps, max_steps, args.lr)
for param_group in opt.param_groups:
    param_group['lr'] = current_lr
```

**Why This Change:**
- **Warmup Phase (100 steps):** Prevents early training instability from large gradients
- **Cosine Decay:** Smooth learning rate reduction that often outperforms linear decay
- **Stability:** Reduces risk of training divergence, especially with AdamW
- **Standard Practice:** Used in modern language models (GPT, BERT, etc.)

**Expected Impact:** More stable training and better final convergence

### 3. Hyperparameter Optimization

**What Changed:**
```python
# Before
lr: float = 6e-3
weight_decay: float = 0.0
warmup_steps: int = 100  # New

# After  
lr: float = 3e-4  # Lower LR for AdamW
weight_decay: float = 0.1  # Add regularization
warmup_steps: int = 100  # Warmup steps
```

**Why This Change:**
- **Lower Learning Rate:** AdamW works better with smaller learning rates (3e-4 vs 6e-3)
- **Weight Decay:** Prevents overfitting and improves generalization (0.1 vs 0.0)
- **Beta Values:** (0.9, 0.95) optimized for language models

**Expected Impact:** Better convergence and reduced overfitting

### 4. Enhanced Monitoring with TensorBoard

**What Changed:**
```python
# Added TensorBoard logging
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

# Setup
writer = SummaryWriter(args.tensorboard_log_dir)

# Training metrics
writer.add_scalar('Train/Loss', loss.item(), step)
writer.add_scalar('Train/LearningRate', current_lr, step)
writer.add_scalar('Train/Perplexity', math.exp(loss.item()), step)

# Validation metrics
writer.add_scalar('Val/Loss', val_loss, step)
writer.add_scalar('Val/Perplexity', val_perplexity, step)
```

**Why This Change:**
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Track training progress and identify issues
- **Rich Visualizations:** Loss curves, learning rate schedules, perplexity metrics
- **Debugging:** Easier to identify training problems and optimize further
