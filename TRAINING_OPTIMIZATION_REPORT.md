## Detailed Changes Made

### 1. Optimizer Upgrade: SGD → AdamW

#### Code Changes
```python
# BEFORE (Baseline)
opt = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=args.lr, weight_decay=args.weight_decay)
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(opt, T_max=max_steps)

# AFTER (Optimized)
opt = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=args.lr, weight_decay=args.weight_decay, betas=(0.9, 0.95))
# Custom learning rate scheduling (see below)
```

#### Why AdamW?
- **Adaptive Learning Rates:** Each parameter gets its own learning rate based on gradient history
- **Momentum:** Keeps moving in good directions, slows down in bad ones
- **Sparse Gradients:** Handles the sparse gradient patterns common in transformers
- **Weight Decay:** Decoupled weight decay prevents overfitting more effectively
- **Proven Performance:** Standard choice for modern language models

#### Expected Impact
- 10-15% improvement in convergence speed
- Better handling of sparse gradients
- More stable training dynamics

### 2. Learning Rate Scheduling: Warmup + Cosine Decay

#### Code Changes
```python
# NEW: Custom learning rate function
def get_lr(step: int, warmup_steps: int, max_steps: int, base_lr: float) -> float:
    """Learning rate with warmup + cosine decay"""
    if step < warmup_steps:
        return base_lr * step / warmup_steps
    else:
        progress = (step - warmup_steps) / (max_steps - warmup_steps)
        return base_lr * 0.5 * (1 + math.cos(math.pi * progress))

# Applied in training loop
current_lr = get_lr(step, args.warmup_steps, max_steps, args.lr)
for param_group in opt.param_groups:
    param_group['lr'] = current_lr
```

#### Why Warmup + Cosine Decay?
- **Warmup Phase (100 steps):** Prevents early training instability from large gradients
- **Cosine Decay:** Smooth reduction often outperforms linear decay
- **Stability:** Reduces risk of training divergence
- **Standard Practice:** Used in GPT, BERT, and other modern models

#### Learning Rate Schedule Visualization
```
Step 0-100:   Linear warmup from 0 to 3e-4
Step 100-938: Cosine decay from 3e-4 to near 0
```

### 3. Hyperparameter Optimization

#### Code Changes
```python
# BEFORE (Baseline)
@dataclass
class Hyperparameters:
    lr: float = 6e-3          # Too high for AdamW
    weight_decay: float = 0.0  # No regularization
    warmup_steps: int = 100    # New parameter

# AFTER (Optimized)
@dataclass
class Hyperparameters:
    lr: float = 3e-4          # Lower LR for AdamW
    weight_decay: float = 0.1  # Add regularization
    warmup_steps: int = 100    # Warmup steps
```

#### Why These Values?
- **Learning Rate (3e-4):** AdamW works better with smaller learning rates
- **Weight Decay (0.1):** Prevents overfitting, improves generalization
- **Beta Values (0.9, 0.95):** Optimized for language models
- **Warmup Steps (100):** ~10% of total training steps

### 4. Enhanced Monitoring with TensorBoard

#### Code Changes
```python
# Added TensorBoard support
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

# Setup
writer = SummaryWriter(args.tensorboard_log_dir)

# Training metrics
writer.add_scalar('Train/Loss', loss.item(), step)
writer.add_scalar('Train/LearningRate', current_lr, step)
writer.add_scalar('Train/Perplexity', math.exp(loss.item()), step)

# Validation metrics
writer.add_scalar('Val/Loss', val_loss, step)
writer.add_scalar('Val/Perplexity', val_perplexity, step)
```

#### Why TensorBoard?
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Track training progress
- **Rich Visualizations:** Loss curves, learning rate schedules
- **Debugging:** Identify training issues quickly
- **Documentation:** Visual proof of improvements
